[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/plues/plues.github.io.svg?branch=sourceFiles)](https://travis-ci.org/plues/plues.github.io)

This branch contains the source files of https://plues.github.io

We use a third-party library to support multiple languages (jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin). 
Therefore, we need to provide a precompiled version (i.e. the folder _site/) which is located on the master branch.

The build and deploy to the master branch is automated using travis so just push your changes to the sourceFiles branch.
